# Syndicate

Simplifying Huge Loan Process and Reducing Risk

## Introduction
When a borrower requires a sum of money that is too large to be provided by a single lender, or outside the scope of the lender’s risk-exposure level, funds are agglomerated from a number of lenders in a process termed as debt syndication.

The Need for Debt Syndication in India

A number of businesses in the Indian market today could use additional financing solutions for the financial leverage required to scale operations and grow. For a long time, firms in the Indian market have suffered from a lack of options in financing solutions since the debt market in India was less developed than the equity market. Although the equity route is a viable one for raising funds, it provides the investor with a claim to the business and dilutes the ownership interest of the founders. For this reason, many company owners choose to retain their claim to ownership of the business and restrain themselves from seeking equity funds.

In recent times, however, debt syndication in India has helped bridge the gap between equity markets and debt markets in India. The growth in the availability of syndicated loans means that owners have alternative methods to raise funds for their companies without having to dilute their ownership. In the future, the availability of these loans is only expected to rise based on the trends of other countries like Japan, Korea, and the USA who have developed debt markets.

## Advantages of  using Matic
Polygon is a multi-chain and complete system that resolves the traditional Etheruem’s issues of throughput, poor user experience, and scaling, unlike Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche, Polygon taking the advantages of Ethereum’s security, openness, and the ecosystem, the Polygon project removes the old barriers of interoperability and scaling of many blockchains, due to its compatibility with Ethereum blockchain make it more attractive for Ethereum based smart contract developers, the architecture depends on four layers, which further divided into two categories of mandatory layer and optional layer, the Polygon networks layer, and Execution layer fall into the mandatory layer.
